	p This tool is intended to be a simple, self-hosted explorer for the #{coinConfig.name} blockchain, driven by RPC calls to your own node. This tool is easy to run but lacks some features compared to database-backed explorers.

	p I built this tool because I wanted to use it myself. Whatever reasons one might have for running a full node (trustlessness, technical curiosity, supporting the network, etc) it's helpful to appreciate the "fullness" of your own node. With this explorer, you can not only explore the blockchain (in the traditional sense of the term "explorer"), but also explore the functional capabilities of your own node.

	p Pull requests are welcome!
